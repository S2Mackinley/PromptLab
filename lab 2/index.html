    <p>
        Hi my name is Elijah Prom. I am a twenty five year old male who recenetly moved to Seattle Washington. I come from a small town thats self 
        proclaimed <em>"The Cowboy Capitol Of The World"</em>. I moved here with my lovely girlfriend Hannah and my two dogs Django and Luna. They are both
        german shepherds. Previously I was a local 99 union electrcian. I left behind that life to become a <strong>Software Developer.</strong> Currently 
        I am taking classes at Codefellows! I hope you enjoy this site and the many more to come.
